Program

A-team

The A-team is the highest level of ultimate at UChicago, representing the University in the USA Ultimate DI College Division, and as such represents a serious commitment.

Tryouts for the A-team occur in the first few week of fall quarter. After cuts, A-teamers have 2-3 days of practice per week until the season ends, 2-3 days of fitness and throwing "pod" per week, and 3 pre-series tournaments.

B-team





Strength and Conditioning

"Monsters of the Midway"

Given the harsh Chicago winter, UC Ultimate has limited access to field space throughout the heart of the academic year. Therefore, when the weather turns sour in late fall we trim practice, head inside, and turn to the most basic tenet of modern athletic training: Lift heavy, lift often. Following fall cuts, the A-team separates into small fitness "pods" and begins a powerlifting and conditioning regimen catered to the power athlete. By the series, our players are big, fast highlight factories.
